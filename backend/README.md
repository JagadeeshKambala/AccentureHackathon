AI Agent Execution Process â€“ Job Screening AI System
This system uses a multi-agent architecture to streamline recruitment tasks using on-prem LLMs (via Ollama) and custom Python agents. Below is the detailed process of how each agent functions in coordination with the backend and frontend.
ðŸ“Œ 1. Upload Job Description (JD Agent)
Frontend: A form allows uploading a .txt, .pdf, or .docx file containing the job description.
Backend Route: /api/upload-jd
Agent Process:
Extracts the text from the uploaded file.
Sends it to a local LLM (e.g., Mistral or Gemma via Ollama) for summarization.
Stores the summarized JD in the database (SQLite) with a unique job ID.
Output: Returns a summary and Job ID to the frontend.
ðŸ“Œ 2. Upload Resume (Resume Parser & Matcher Agent)
Frontend: A form where the user uploads a resume and selects the corresponding Job ID.
Backend Route: /api/upload-resume
Agent Process:
Extracts content from resume (.pdf/.docx).
Retrieves the JD summary for the selected Job ID.
Sends both to the matching agent (powered by the LLM) to compute:
Candidate profile summary
Relevance/match score
Stores the parsed candidate profile and score in the database.
Output: Displays the candidate's match score for the job role.
ðŸ“Œ 3. Shortlisting Agent
Backend Route: /api/shortlist-candidates
Agent Process:
Compares all stored candidate scores for a selected Job ID.
Filters and returns candidates who exceed a threshold (e.g., 70% match score).
Output: Returns a list of shortlisted candidates with names and scores.
ðŸ“Œ 4. Interview Scheduler Agent
Frontend: A form where the recruiter inputs:
Candidate name
Job ID
Interview date and time
Backend Route: /api/schedule-interview
Agent Process:
Verifies candidate and job entry.
Generates a formatted email or calendar invite message.
Schedules the interview (message is returned for email integration).
Output: Displays a success message with interview details ready for sending.
ðŸ§  LLM Integration
All agents interact with local LLMs using Ollama and models like:
mistral
gemma:2b
Communication occurs via API-like functions that process job/resume context and return structured responses.
